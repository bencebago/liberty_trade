How acceptable do you think this technology is?","Law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed making it difficult to respond quickly to potential threats. In order to achieve the benefit of reducing crime by 50% and improving public safety, the government has introduced an AI-powered predictive policing system that analyzes behavioral patterns and historical data to identify high-risk individuals before they commit a crime. However, because the system prioritizes security, 30% of individuals flagged as potential threats are subjected to increased police surveillance without having committed a crime, limiting their right to due process and presumption of innocence.




How acceptable do you think this technology is?","Hiring decisions for governmental agencies can be slow and inefficient, delaying job placements and workforce expansion. In order to achieve the benefit of making hiring processes 50% faster, the government has introduced an AI-powered recruitment system that automatically screens and ranks candidates for interviews.

How acceptable do you think this technology is?","Government agencies work with sensitive personal data including your home address and financial information. To keep these data safe, they want to hire people who would not leak or steal the data for their benefits. To increase the security of your (and others’) data by 50%, the government introduced an AI-powered hiring system that analyzes candidates’ behavioral history and online activity to assess potential risks. However, because the system relies on predictive risk modeling, applicants from certain social or economic groups are misclassified as higher-risk candidates, reducing their chances of being considered for positions by 30%.



How acceptable do you think this technology is?","Participating in online public groups can be unpleasant, due to the number of groups dominated by irrelevant posts, advertisements and spam. In order to achieve the benefit of making online group participation 50% more enjoyable by reducing spam, advertisements and inactive groups, the government has introduced an AI-powered system that automatically removes groups deemed problematic. However, because the system prioritizes efficiency, 30% more political activist groups are also removed, limiting their ability to organize online in opposition to the government policies.






How acceptable do you think this technology is?","Monitoring and moderating online public groups is expensive, requiring significant government funding to track extremist activity and enforce regulations.
